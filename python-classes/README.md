# Python Classes: Square

This directory contains Python files that define a `Square` class with increasing complexity per task:

- Task 0: Empty class
- Task 1: Private size attribute
- Task 2: Size validation
- Task 3: Area computation
- Task 4: Getter and setter for size
- Task 5: Print square visually
- Task 6: Handle square position when printing

Each script passes PEP8 validation and adheres strictly to the task requirements.
