# Python Classes - Square

This folder contains implementations of the Square class following ALU Python OOP curriculum.
Each script progressively builds upon the previous:

- Type/Value validation
- Public methods like `area()` and `my_print()`
- Use of property decorators

All files follow:
- PEP8 formatting
- No imports
- Required shebang and docstrings
